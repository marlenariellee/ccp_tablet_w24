        <h1>Double Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

        <p>Category: Dessert</p>
        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <p>Category: Dessert</p>
        <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert. </p>

        <p>Category: Breakfast</p>
        <p>These Swedish Pancakes are a family favorite and are perfect for a special breakfast or brunch. They are thin and delicate, similar to a crepe, and are typically served with lingonberry jam and a dusting of powdered sugar. Fresh berries are a nice addition as well. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, combine the eggs, milk, flour, sugar, salt, melted butter, vanilla and water. Blend until smooth. Let the batter rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter to the pan and swirl to coat. Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until the edges of the pancake begin to brown and the top is set, about 1 minute. Flip and cook for another 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining batter, stacking the pancakes on top of each other as you go.</li>
            <li>Spread each pancake with a thin layer of lingonberry jam and roll up. Dust with powdered sugar and serve with fresh berries.</li>
